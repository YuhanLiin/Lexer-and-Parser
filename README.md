# Lexer-and-Parser
A complete parser generator which tokenizes the input string before creating an abstract syntax tree by processing the tokens with a context-free grammar. The tokens are defined using the regex library and the actual parser an implementation of Earley's parsing algorithm. The files are to be imported so that the functions can be used in other programs. The Lexer file can read strings and turn them into a list of "Token" objects which are parsed by the Parser file to make an AST. Thus, usage of the two files' functions must be in that order and synchronized (same token names...).
